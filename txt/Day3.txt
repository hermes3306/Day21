“Day 3 done”

1. Meditate 10-15, even 20 minutes if you have time. Repeat the Sanskrit mantra “Sat Chit Ananda, Sat Chit Ananda” when you feel distracting thoughts and hear noises. Focus your breathing in and breathing out.

2. Practice - creating your reality by drawing bank notes(KRW or 💵), checks to deposit into your bank accounts, stocks, bonds, coins and any other means of payment in your beautiful notebook.

- Draw enough to pay off all the debts and expenses you wrote down yesterday or future debt for say a new home, new car, college education, retirement, etc. 😊

- You have complete freedom to create and draw the solution. We draw in order to make it possible to pay for everything you need in the universe!

- Let your imagination and your creativity run wild. You can use pens, pencils, or colored pencils and pens, paints etc.

- Draw bills, coins, wads of money, bags of money, money raining down 😄 - whatever you want! 💵💰🍀🎋💸🤑

- Remember, this is NOT an art lesson, but is practice in allowing yourself to CREATE your reality and let it manifest in your life.

- While you are drawing, feel the satisfaction of creating a balance between debts and expenses and the means of payment that you create - as if it were a real payment of your expenses and debts.

- Have fun with it!  ❤✨🍀✨

3. PHRASE OF THE DAY: (write in notebook)

* “Today I focus on what I want to attract into my life.”

Enjoy your day! Feel light & peace in learning -  creating your thought —>to your destiny. I’m so grateful you’re walking with me on this path right now 🙏🏽😘💚🌳🌏 namaste~
