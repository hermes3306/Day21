Day 2: Wednesday, 6 May 2020

Please complete Day 2 by Wednesday 11:59pm in your timezone.

Don’t forget when you complete the tasks, please write the message:

“Day 2 done”

It may seem simple to some people but not to others. Take your time, don’t overthink and just do your best...

Remember, if the task seems difficult for you to complete, any task, there is a block - an obstacle in your mind on the path towards attaining/attracting (like magnets to metal) abundance. 

Just be aware of this and “stick with it” (keep it up, don’t give up)! You can do this!

1. Meditate 10-15 minutes  https://youtu.be/1ZYbU82GVz4

2. Write all of your debts in your notebook: 
- a. Debt on a bank loan, credit cards, car loans, mortgage, personal loans, debts to individuals - all of your debts of any kind.

* *DO NOT record the amount*, only who is owed and for what. For example:

* Finance company - mortgage
* Car manufacturer - car loan
* Credit cards
* 아버지 - loan to me for children’s academy fees

- b. After that make a list of all your monthly payments. *Not the KRW amount, just the “type” of monthly payments. No numbers, like the following:

- rent or mortgage
- Car loan
- electricity
- gas
- water
- accountant
- School fees
- gym

- This list you are creating, is a complete list of “sources” of your monthly expenses, constant and changing. For some, this list will be “extensive” (large, long). 

- Give yourself time to calmly walk through all the areas of your life in which you pay money. You may need to add what you remember “throughout” the day. 
3. PHRASE OF THE DAY: (write in notebook)

* “I create my personal abundance from an “infinite” (related to ∞) source.

4. Answer the question, “What does abundance mean to me?”
