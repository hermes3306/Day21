Day 4 - Friday, 8 May 2020

Welcome to Day 4!

Please complete Day 4 by Friday 11:59pm in your timezone.

Don’t forget when you complete the tasks, please write the message:

“Day 4 done”

1. Meditate 10-15, even 20 minutes if you have time. Repeat the Sanskrit mantra “Aham Bramasmi, Aham Bramasma” when you feel distracting thoughts and hear noises. Focus your breathing in and breathing out.
2. Make a list of people in your family or “environment” whom you consider to be “prosperous” (successful in financial terms) but also prosperous in achieving life goals, are happy or at least seem happy and have joy.

- These should be people you personally know and have access to.

- These can be people from the previous list. How many people?  Doesn’t matter. Even two is enough.

- Please remember, the more attention and “reflection” you give to these simple tasks, the greater the “return” (results).. 

3. PHRASE OF THE DAY: (write in notebook)

* “From this moment forward, I invite unlimited abundance into my life.” ♾ (infinity symbol)🌿

Have a great meditation and an abundant day!

Big love 💚🌏
